# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Planning my device:
 - _Setting:_ Any indoor environment where one would keep a potted plant, e.g. inside a home or office. The device is located inside a plant pot.
 - _Players:_ Anyone who uses the space. For example, tenants of an apartment or employees in an office space. 
 - _Activity:_ When the first two inches of soil in the pot are dry, the device lights up, indicating that the plant needs to be watered.
 - _Goals:_ The goal of the players is to water their potted plants only when they need water (i.e. first two inches of soil are dry) in order to avoid either overwatering or underwatering the plants in the space. 

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

![storyboard](storyboard.png "Storyboard")

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

I presented my idea to Adam (Yuzhen) Zhang, Daan van der Zwaag, JJ (Jiejun) Tian. Feedback received:
 - Different plants have different watering needs in terms of schedule and quantity, so the device could be more customizable
 - Different frequency of flashing light or different color shades could be used to represent different levels of moisture in the soil.
 - Future work could incorporate other needs that plants have such as fertlizer.


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

The idea of using different shades of a color to indicate changing moisture level of the soil worked better on paper than acted out. In reality, having subtle/gradual shifts in color shades would be difficult to notice without a basis for comparison, since the device would only show a single color at a time. Additionally, on paper, the idea was that the device could be placed in any plant pot, but after acting out the interaction with my phone, it's evident that I need to make sure the plant pot is an appropriate size to make sure the device fits in the pot and to avoid the pot tipping over.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

After acting out the interaction, I could instead use a single color, but use flashing lights to indicate priority of actions required. For example, consistent red light to indicate that the plant needs to be watered, but flashing red light to indicate urgency (e.g. the plant hasn't been watered for two weeks after the light originally came on). I also need to make sure the device is waterproof since the device will be located in the plant pot. 


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

I ran into technical issues using Tinkerbelle, so instead used a [color-picker web app](http://color.aurlien.net/). 

## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Since I wasn't able to use Tinkerbelle, I created a Zoom meeting with my phone as one participant and my laptop as another participant. I then shared my laptop screen in the meeting so that the color picker app could be controlled from my laptop and displayed on my phone screen. See my [wizarding setup video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13IFCEg6kqjbDAHrx17vgF_u3QHQSaYiY/view?usp=sharing).

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

For my initial paper prototype, the goal was to water the plant when the device displayed a red light. See my [initial interaction video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mppsxm0C4Q7ociPwsPNEKLuSpo1amkKk/view?usp=sharing).

I then changed my goal to have the user check the soil moisture level manually when the device started flashing the red light. See my [second interaction video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r7WZqxrW8B5Wjm6NsCE9SMl8csh3G4Wa/view?usp=sharing).



## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

My initial costume sketch:

![costume_sketch](costume_sketch.png "Costume Sketch")

The costume I created:

![costume_without_phone](costume_no_phone.png "Costume Without Phone")

![costume_front](costume_front.png "Costume Front View")

![costume_back](costume_back.png "Costume Back View")


\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

I used a plastic sandwich bag, chopsticks, and packing tape to assemble the costume. My key concern was that the device needed to be prtoected from water so that it would not have to be removed from the plant, then re-inserted every time the user watered the plant. Wrapping the device in the sealed sandwich bag allowed me to protect the device will still allowing light from the screen to shine through unobstructed. Additionally, I wanted to make sure that the device would be able to catch the attention of someone who may not be as well-versed in checking the health and needs of their plant, while still maintaining keeping the device relatively simple to avoid visually taking over the plant. Attaching the device to the chopsticks allowed for greater stability and visibility of the device. 

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

See my [prototyped interaction video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y1wLhG1S0_EmyUPuJtHsOFo1i-D70u-r/view?usp=sharing).

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*

I worked with Adam (Yuzhen) Zhang, Daan van der Zwaag, JJ (Jiejun) Tian. My sister (not a CT student) helped me film the interaction videos!


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
